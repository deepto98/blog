## About this site

Hi, this is Deepto, I'm a software developer passionate about distributed systems. 
Currently, I’m working as an LFX mentee on a project to integrate BDLS, 
a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol into the ordering service of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. 
Previously, I worked as a backend developer at Astra Security, an infosec SAAS company. 
I also contribute to open source projects and love learning new things everyday.
