<i>In this series of write ups, I'll document my journey of learning Kubernetes. I have used k8s in the past, but I'm yet to discover all its nooks and crannies. I'm starting by following Vilito Exquisitus's Youtube Playlist on k8s(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0aDKsruoiW3DRr1tMK4r7EGa5DU8Xhoc), but eventually I'll follow whatever resources I can find, and will try to experiment by building something and deploying it with k8s wherever I can.</i> 

### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a container orchestration framework which facilitates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. It allows us deploy and manage multi-container workloads.
### The need for Kubernetes
The short of it is, since we have moved from deploying apps on physical servers to VMs to containers, we need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime in a production environment. This is where k8s comes in. Some use cases:
* When a container fails, start a new container : Self-healing
* Scaling resources in and out, based on CPU usage : Horizontal scaling

### Making a simple app with microservices
Before diving into k8s components, I want to code a simple microservice app, so I can understand and explain things from a code POV from the get go. This is the architecture, it has 2 services and a server and a persistent store, its similar to a Producer-Consumer architecture:
